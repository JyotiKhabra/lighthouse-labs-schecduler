# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page React app.

I was able to take to achieve some personal firsts during this project. Along with using React for the first time i was also able to implement that use of websocket to update the results appointments being booked multiple servers. I was also aply to deploy the project, Heroku was used to deploy that API, and Netlify was used to deploy the webpack development server. You are able to view the active site at https://scheduleit.netlify.app/.
